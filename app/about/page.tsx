  About Me
</h1>
      <p>Hi, I’m Aleksandar — welcome to my personal homepage!
        <br>
I’m an undergraduate student studying economics at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz and work as a student assistant sysadmin at the chair of Prof. Dr. Franz Rothlauf (Information Systems and Business Administration).
<br>
Outside of my studies and work, I spend a lot of time with various IT projects. I run several self-hosted services on my own hardware and enjoy playing around with telephony systems such as Cisco CallManager, HiCom, and HiPath.
<br>
Other than that I like to go for walks and cycling.</p>
