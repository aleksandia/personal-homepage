      <p>
        Hi, I’m Aleksandar — welcome to my personal homepage!
        <br /><br />
        I’m an undergraduate student in Economics at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz and work as a student assistant in system administration at the Chair of Prof. Dr. Franz Rothlauf (Information Systems and Business Administration).
        <br /><br />
        Outside of my studies and work, I spend a lot of time with various IT projects. I run several self-hosted services on my own hardware and enjoy experimenting with telephony systems such as Cisco CallManager, HiCom, and HiPath.
        <br /><br />
        Beyond technology, I like going for walks and cycling.
