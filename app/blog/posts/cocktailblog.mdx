title: 'Cocktailblog back online'
publishedAt: '2025-01-22'
summary: 'My Cocktailblog is now back online. What started as a project is now publicly available.'
---

The Cocktailblog is a little project I started during my first year as an undergrad. It’s a cocktail recipe website with a built-in blog so members can share and communicate.
Anyone can sign up using their name and email address. Right now, I’m in the middle of updating the recipes, so it’s not super useful at the moment. For now, the site is only in German, but I’m planning to add multi-language support eventually.

## How to Access the Cocktailblog
You can check out the Cocktailblog here: https://cocktailblog.fwh.is/. You’ll need to register for an account to access the content.

## How It Works
The Cocktailblog is lightweight and runs on PHP, HTML, and a little JavaScript. Everything—from recipes to blog posts—is stored in a MySQL database. User registration is also handled by MySQL, and passwords are encrypted before being saved to keep things secure.

## Changelog
If you’re interested, there’s a changelog that I keep updated in a separate wiki. You can find it here: https://cocktailblog.fwh.is/wiki/index.php/Changelog.

## Feedback
Please note that minimal changes have been made to the Cocktailblog recently. Your feedback may be directed to my email address.
